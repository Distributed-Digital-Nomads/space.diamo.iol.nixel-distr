<b>P/PS</b> (Project or Profit Stake). All iol users can participate in the fee share out of iol providers. It proceed as following:<br>
- after payment for job and cut fee from worker/customer the system calculates stakes from fee in proportion to amount of SINHRO put into the iol provider where the job has been done;<br>
- the stakes are added to the user balances in the currency paid for the job.<br>
Users can put SINHRO in iol provider and take them back in detailed description of iol providers.<br>

<b>iol provider</b> is a software running in iol ecosystem using iol features. Users can use the iol builder to create iol providers. The user or user group that created a iol provider becomes the author of the iol provider. The basic concept of iol providers is: the performer (worker) must arrive at the place of work with some tools and do job for the customer. iol provider can work using one of the algorithms provided by iol:<br>
- fixed amount of payment for job;<br>
- time base payment for job (price for hour);<br>
- payment for job based on distance (price for meter);<br>
- payment for job based on combination of time and distance (price for hour + price for meter).<br>
An iol provider can be a commercial application and and configured by the author to take fee from users as part of payment for job. iol generates <b>SINHRO</b> in an amount proportional to the size of the fee and puts to the users' balance in NiXeL that paid the fee. Thus, SINHRO appears only when some job has been done actually. The fee will be shared out to users in proportion to their SINHRO invested in this iol provider. Users can invest and take back their SINHRO to/from iol providers in the <b>P/PS</b> (Project or Profit Stake) section of balance in NiXeL. SINHRO allows users to have passive income from fees. For example, workers that have seasonal job are able to have income from fees in other iol providers where provided other kind of job.<br>
