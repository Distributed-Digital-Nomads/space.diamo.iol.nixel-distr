<b>Terms and Conditions of Use of the NiXeL App</b><br>
Edition: 2022-08-01<br>
<br>
This electronic document is a Smart Contract type of T0 (onwards </b>Smart Contract T0</b>).<br>
<br>
<b>Terms</b><br>
<br>
<b>NiXel</b> is a free software, app of Distributed Digital Nomads.<br> NiXeL works in  The Internet of Labour ecosystem/platform (abbreviated <b>iol</b>). NiXeL allows users to sign up in iol and visually interact with iol's features. NiXeL has not own servers (back-end) and uses numerous of third party libraries, modules, frameworks etc. NiXeL is a Graphical User Interface (<b>GUI</b>) that provides electronic document management for users using Smart Orders, Smart Contracts, Smart Accounts and Smart Receipts.<br>
NiXeL takes over the following functions:<br>
- user registration in iol (sign up);<br>
- user authorisation in <b>iol providers</b>;<br>
- notifications about orders, job state, correspondence, balance state etc.;<br>
- job timing control;<br>
- distance calculation control;<br>
- payment for job performed by users in iol providers;<br>
- quality control of performers (workers) and their customers in iol providers: the mechanism <b>iol quality</b>;<br>
NiXeL has an internal balance of funds, which provides the following features:<br>
- mutual settlements between users;<br>
- currency exchange;<br>
- balance refill;<br>
- withdrawal currencies from balance in NiXeL to private bank account of users.<br>
<u>NiXeL does not provide financial services</u>. It uses iol and licensed Financial Service Providers (<b>FSP</b>).<br>
iol also has the ability to conduct Peer to Peer (<b>P2P</b>) transactions directly between users without the FSP participation.<br>
The following application permissions are required to enable all features of NiXeL:<br>
- push notification;<br>
- music player: to play your ringtones for different types of notifications;<br>
- camera and photo access: to upload profile photos and read QR codes;<br>
- location access when the in the background: to calculate the time and distance during job performance and the location of the customer/worker near before time when a job must be start. Also, it saves a lot of resources on your device than keeping the app open with open screen.<br>
Wide range of NiXeL features saves users time, because users do not need sign up in every iol provider. iol providers use login via NiXeL. Also, it:
- reduces the size of iol providers, since repetitive functionality realized in NiXeL;
- is more secure for users of iol providers, since users don't need to give permissions for each iol provider;
- provides reliability of payment for performed job and safety of money and assets;
- gives possibility to participate in fee shares of any iol providers from the same place.<br>
NiXeL operates under Distributed Digital Nomads (DDN) registered in https://github.com/Distributed-Digital-Nomads as a private virtual non-commercial foundation.<br>
<br>
<b>iol</b> (The Internet of Labour) is a decentralized/distributed ecosystem/platform as one of the possible solution to solve the global unemployment problem. iol is a socio-economic ecosystem/platform. iol as a distributed system uses third-party resources such as github, file and data storage services, cloud services, blockchain and API of FSPs. Also, it uses distributed database technology based on BloodVessels methodology.<br>
<br>
<b>iol provider</b> is a software running in iol ecosystem using iol features. Users can use the iol builder to create iol providers. The user or user group that created a iol provider becomes the author of the iol provider. The basic concept of iol providers is: the performer (worker) must arrive at the place of work with some tools and do job for the customer. iol provider can work using one of the algorithms provided by iol:<br>
- fixed amount of payment for job;<br>
- time base payment for job (price for hour);<br>
- payment for job based on distance (price for meter);<br>
- payment for job based on combination of time and distance (price for hour + price for meter).<br>
An iol provider can be a commercial application and and configured by the author to take fee from users as part of payment for job. iol generates <b>SINHRO</b> in an amount proportional to the size of the fee and puts to the users' balance in NiXeL that paid the fee. Thus, SINHRO appears only when some job has been done actually. The fee will be shared out to users in proportion to their SINHRO invested in this iol provider. Users can invest and take back their SINHRO to/from iol providers in the <b>P/PS</b> (Project or Profit Stake) section of balance in NiXeL. SINHRO allows users to have passive income from fees. For example, workers that have seasonal job are able to have income from fees in other iol providers where provided other kind of job.<br>
iol provider must have its own "Terms and Conditions" for its users that does not contradict the Smart Contract T0, "Terms and Conditions of the iol builder application" and the conditions of the iol franchise for iol providers.<br>
Payment for job will be done according the section <b>«2. Order of payment for job»</b>.<br>
The ability to add iol providers to the ecosystem makes iol a platform.<br>
NiXeL is essentially a non-commercial iol provider with access to special iol features. NiXeL does not take fees for use it. Expenses for support it carried out only from the <b>Royalty/Donation</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>User</b> of NiXeL is a person that runs the NiXeL application and/or interacts with the NiXeL app. A user that has registered own username in the iol and/or logged in with his username is called a Registered User.<br>
All users receive 40 IOU in their balance after profile <b>Activation</b>.<br>
There is another special type of users: <b>Authors</b>. The user may be invited to become an Author, for example, by actively participating in iol open source resources at https://github.com/internet-of-labour or iol provider open source resources at https://github.com/Distributed-Digital-Nomads. The invitation will be send in the <b>Correspondence</b> feature of NiXeL.<br>
<br>
<b>Author</b> is a user participates in the creation and/or improvement parts of iol. According to natural laws Authors have exclusive copyrights in fact and from the moment of creation their parts of system. Authors should have compensation for their job. Authors get Royalty/Donation in proportion to  their SINHRO that input in NiXeL app. It ensures the voluntary payment of royalties by other users for the Authors' job.<br>
Terms and Conditions for Authors of iol expands this Terms and Conditions.<br>
<br>
<b>FSP</b> (Financial Services Provider) is an official registered and licensed organizations with rights to financial services (banks, credit organizations and foundations, stock exchanges, payment systems and/or their aggregators, etc.). NiXeL holds currencies and regulated assets in FSPs' accounts that can be registered by the authors of the system.<br>
<br>
<b>Correspondence</b> — internal module of NiXeL for personal and group correspondence of users. This module looks like chat apps or messengers. But NiXeL is not a messenger and does not allow to:<br>
- manually create groups;<br>
- hide profile;<br>
- delete or hide own messages.<br>
The correspondence module is used in NiXeL for:<br>
- support users in different languages. The group correspondences in various languages are available in menu «FAQ & Support»;<br>
- private chats correspondence between users. For example, a worker and a customer can use it to discuss job conditions;<br>
- public discussions for <b>Crowdfunding</b> projects;<br>
- public discussions in <b>Insurance</b> module;<br>
- public discussions in <b>Charity</b> module;<br>
- feedback of workers and customers. Ecosystem iol creates a group chat for all iol “provider – user” pair. All users can read these chat. The owner user of this chat and his customers or workers that had at least one deal in the iol provider can write in this kind of chats. The section <b>iol quality</b> of this Smart Contract T0 provides more detailed information.<br>
Group chats can have own rules and official members such as User support, Technical support, Moderator, Financial support, Legal support, System administrator, Developer, Architect that are in a hierarchical relationship within this group and have multi-colored headings in messages.<br>
<br>
<b>iol quality</b> is an organizational and technical mechanism for quality control of performers and customers of jobs. iol quality includes job evaluation by the customer, customer evaluation by the performer of the job and feedback.<br>
After job completion the customer and the job performer will be offered to evaluate each other on an 11-point system: marks from -5 (very bad) to 5 (excellent), 0 if indifferent/neutral. The evaluation number will be calculated as mark multiplied by amount of SINHRO that has been given for fee. The evaluation number will be added to total rate of user in the iol provider where the job has been taken.<br>
The rating is calculated relative to the maximum of the scores of all users as a performer or customer in the iol provider. The ratings are separated for users as for worker or as for customer.<br>
The ratings are available to see in user’s profile for all users. Customers see the list of workers that applied for a Smart Order sorted by rating descending.<br>
After evaluation users will be offered to leave a feedback in group chat that created for each pair “user - iol provider”.
The customer and worker can sort things out related to the job or give thanks. Other users can read feedback chats. Any user can open all group chats of other users from their profile.<br>
Workers are able to open profile of the customer who created Smart Order for job. Customers can see profile of the potential workers that applied for the job. From profiles users can open ratings and feedback chats. It is helps to make decision to apply for the job or hire a worker.<br>
<br>
<b>Activation</b> is an automatic verification.<br>
All users receive 40 IOU in their balance after profile activation. Activation requires to provided in profile at least First name, Family name, Birth date and 1 identification document (ID cartd, driver license or passport) with 2 pictures.<br>
<br>
<b>Verification</b> is a manual verification, in which the user support moderator matches the data provided by the user upon activation.<br>
Verification is intended for additional protection of user balance. Providing false or other people's information may lead to the user's account lockout in accordance with this Smart Contract T0.<br>
<br>
<b>IOU</b> — “I Owe You” of the Internet of Labor iol-ecosystem/platform»: The idea of IOU comes from that any job has been done in some place must cost the same as the same job is done in another place. For instance, you have done some job in a country for 1 IOU. It means that you can order the same job in another country for 1 IOU. But a problem arise here: a job costs different amount in different countries. iol has a solution: 1 IOU must equal 1 hour minimal wage of the country where the job has been done.<br>
The architecture of iol allows pay for job by IOU. Also, it can temporary partly solve local and global economic problems.<br>
In essence, IOU is not any currency or asset. IOU can be defined as <b>”Unnamed Bearer IOU”</b>. In this way, mutual repayment of debts is ensured.<br>
IOU cannot be bought or sold for any currency. This is how the “work-price” price balance is achieved in countries with different economic levels and harmonization with local regulations.<br>
<br>
<b>SINHRO</b> internal mechanism of iol for synchronizing the balance in iol, official currencies of countries, regulated assets, shares of commissions of iol providers, copyright and intellectual properties, digital assets, global intellectual, law enforcement and financial structures, old and new economies.<br>
SINHRO is backed only by real labour.<br>
Order of SINHRO emission:<br>
- upon completion of the job received in any iol provider, in return for the deducted commissions iol calculates the amount of SINHRO at the current exchange rate to the currency of job cost. This amount of SINHRO is credited to the balance of the user that paid the commission;<br>
- iol issues SINHRO and credits it to the author's balance after the user's job added to the system.<br>
The SINHRO exchange rate relative to other currencies and assets is determined by the transactions made between users. Users that wish to exchange SINHRO to another currency can do that touching SINHRO in NiXeL balance:<br>
- check SINHRO buy/sell offers from other users that wait for matching offers. If you select an offer from this list and specify the quantity, the deal will be executed by <b>SinhroBot</b> immediately;<br>
-  set buy/sell at the desired price and amount. If there are suitable offers in the system, then SinhroBot will execute the deal immediately, otherwise it will be visible in the list “Show other offers” to other users. Own offers that wait for deal user can see in "My offers" list. The amount of the proposed asset will be moved to the Pending field in balance. Users can cancel own offers in “My orders”.<br>
Current SINHRO rate against currencies is determined by the last transaction.<br>
If there is no current exchange rate for a particular currency, then the exchange rate is calculated relative to the current SINHRO exchange rate, recalculated according to the FSP exchange rate.
To limit the amount of SINHRO available in iol system use the following SINHRO extinguishment mechanism:<br>
- in cases when job is for SINHRO (“payment in SINHRO”) the iol provider fee is charged in the same amount as when paying in other currencies. But in those cases it does not make sense in generation new SINHRO. Therefore, fee in SINHRO remains on the account of the iol provider forever as a parameter of the rating of this iol provider. iol providers are not persons so, the amount of SINHRO cannot be used in the iol anymore. This is ensured by SINHRO's inflation countermeasures preventing its depreciation.<br>
<b>SinhroBot</b> can prevent exchange rate manipulation. For example, an attacker wanted to influence the current price of SINHRO by trying to sell a small amount of SINHRO for parice less than others offer. SinhroBot will execute it so: SinhroBot will buy from him for his price and sell for the maximum price in the Buy list. Thus, it will only fix the more expensive cost of SINHRO and it most likely leads to stable growth of SINHRO rate.<br>
SINHRO lets any user the feature to participate in fee share out of all iol providers.<br>
<u>SINHRO is not any kind of currency or asset in countries where taxes cannot be paid in SINHRO and cannot be regulated by of such countries.</u><br>
<b>ATTENTION! Beware of scammers!</b> SINHRO cannot be sold or traded anywhere except on the official NiXeL app.<br>
<br>
<b>P/PS</b> (Project or Profit Stake). All iol users can participate in the fee share out of iol providers. It proceed as following:<br>
- after payment for job and cut fee from worker/customer the system calculates stakes from fee in proportion to amount of SINHRO put into the iol provider where the job has been done;<br>
- the stakes are added to the user balances in the currency paid for the job.<br>
Users can put SINHRO in iol provider and take them back in detailed description of iol providers.<br>
<br>
<b>Royalty/Donation</b> payments to authors is subtracted from a transaction. Amount of royalty/donation can be different for users but cannot be more than 1% of transaction sum. Authors do not pay royalties for transactions because it makes no sense to pay themselves.<br>
Authors use their royalties at their own discretion, including expenses associated with supporting their authoring activities in the iol ecosystem.<br>
<br>
<b>Crowdfunding</b> is a feature of iol as a logical consequence of the ecosystem purpose.
Users can use this feature to implement and improve their activities within the iol ecosystem.<br>
Users can open a crowdfunding project to refine, launch and promote new iol provider, to improve and increase tools used to fulfill orders in iol providers. authors can also use it to implement new ideas or improve exist features in iol.<br>
iol creates a group chat for each crowdfunding project where users can discuss the project and ask questions to the project owner. All crowdfunding projects of users are shown in users profile. All crowdfunding projects of users are shown in users profile that allows users to see results of previouse crowdfunding projects of a user.<br>
<br>
<b>Insurance</b> is designed to fully or partially cover accident expenses that happened during the the job gotten in iol providers.<br>
Provision of classical insurance services requires deep mathematical analysis of statistics. iol does not currently have enough statistics to offer insurance premiums. Therefore, this feature works on the principles of social responsibility, which means payments are voluntary and not fixed:  users make decision how much they are ready to send in other users' particular insurance case.<br>
For example, in an iol provider for painters some user got a job order to paint the ceiling. During the job a customer's dog accidentally spilled paint on the carpet and the customer did not see how it happened. The worker and the customer can agree on who will apply for insurance in NiXeL. One of them can open an insurance case in NiXeL. Other users can view the history of the previous user's insurance cases and send some money to the case.<br>
<br>
<b>Charity</b>. iol as a socio-economic platform supports charitable activities which should solve social issues related to the inferiority of the capabilities of society participants. Или это реализуется так же налоговыми сервисами. So, taxes should be levied after deductions for charitable activities. This feature of the iol ecosystem provides opportunities for users to open private or group requests for a charitable donation to support partially or temporarily disabled people.<br>
<br>
<b>P2P</b> (Peer to Peer) transactions is a mechanism that allows users to conduct transactions currency and assets directly from user to user without the FSP participation. iiol technically and organizationally allows to conduct P2P transactions with a guarantee that users will fulfill the conditions of their transactions. P2P transactions can be useful, for example, to use currencies in iol that are not supported or limited in FSPs. Accordingly, the funds received on the balance through P2P are not stored on the PFC accounts, however, they can be converted into assets supported by the FSP through iol exchange mechanisms.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Conditions of use</b><br>
<br>
<b>1. Private data protection</b><br>
<br>
1.1. All data provided in NiXeL are public and cannot be removed at the request of the user.<br>
<br>
1.2. The user can hide the document from other users in his profile using the “Show other users” toggle.<br>
<br>
1.3. Identification documents provided for activation/verification are recommended to be hidden from other users. However, they will be available to iol moderators for manual user verification.<br>
<br>
1.4. Additional recommendations on the protection of personal data are provided in the section <b>"Tips and Recommendations"</b> of this Smart Contract T0.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Order of payment for job</b><br>
<br>
2.1. When a customer and a contractor (parties) in any iol provider have a dial, i.e. hiring a job performer, NiXeL calculates the preparatory cost for the job (=Psum) based on the settings of the iol provider. The state of the Smart Contract of the job will be set to "Accepted by the parties ".<br>
<br>
2.2. If payment for job is not in cash then the amount equal Psum of the customer’s balance goes to "Pending".<br>
<br>
2.3. Parties are notified in NiXeL abot pending job performance and are offered to share their real-time location. The notification is sent before job start time for the time specified in the settings of the iol provider. This will help to quickly meet the parties at the job place.<br>
<br>
2.4. The parties can inform the system about the start of job by pressing the appropriate button. At the same time, the system sends a notification to the other party that the job performance just began and starts counting according the settings of the iol provider.<br>
<br>
2.5. The worker can inform the system about the pause (temporary suspension) of job by pressing the appropriate button. At the same time, the system sends a notification to the customer about this and suspends counting job cost.<br>
<br>
2.6. Parties can inform the system about the completion of job by pressing the appropriate button. After this event the system does the following:<br>
- sends a notification to the other party that the job has been done;<br>
- calculates actual cost (=Fsum) of the job according settings of the iol provider;<br>
- if Psum equals to Fsum then the amount equal Psum is deducted from the “Pending” balance of the customer and put to the worker's balance;<br>
- if Psum is greater than Fsum then Fsum is deducted from the “Pending” balance of the customer and put to the worker's balance. Amont equal Psum minus Fsum returns from customer's "Pending" to "Available";<br>
- if Psum is less than Fsum then Fsum is deducted from the customer's “Pending” and put to the worker's balance. Amount equal Fsum minus Psum is deducted from the customer's balance and pit to the worker's balance. At the same time, if amount equal Fsum minus Psum is less than the customer have in balance then only the available amount is dedecated. The customer has a debt to the worker that associated with the job Smart Contract.<br>
<br>
2.7. Fees<br>
2.7.1. If the iol provider has settings to charge fees the system will charge that fees from parties.<br>
2.7.2. The amount of the fees is indicated in the job smart contract and deducted from Fsum after payment for job.<br>
2.7.3. 80% of the fees for jobs that has been done not for SINHRO or IOU are put to user balances in proportion to the amount invested in this iol provider. 20% is put to the balance of the user that created this iol provider.<br>
2.7.3. iol generates SINHRO equal to the fee that has been deducted at the current SINHRO rate of job payment currency. If this currency does not have current exchange rate relative to SINHRO then a cross-calculation is used relative to existing rates using FSP exchange rates.<br>
2.7.4. Amount equal SINHRO corresponding to the fee is added to the rating of the iol provider where the job has been done.<br>
2.7.5. If the job has been done for SINHRO or IOU then the amount of SINHRO corresponding to the fee is withdrawn from the iol and added to the iol provider rating.<br>
<br>
2.8. Royalty/Donation is deducted from the parties after fee payment.<br>
<br>
2.9. Fees and Royalty are paid in the job payment currency. If recipients do not have such the currency balance then the system opens a balance in the currency automatically.<br>

The balance remaining after 336 hours is distributed among the authors in proportion to their shares in the NiXeL. The user's SINHROs that left in iol providers will be removed from the iol and that amount added to the iol providers' ratings.<br>
5.1.5. Unblocking unlikely may be carried out by decision of the group described in paragraph 3.6 of this Smart Contract T0.<br>
5.1.6. A NiXeL user lockout prevents the user from using other iol providers that use login with NiXeL. The blocked user cannot register a new username in NiXeL because it is restricted by paragraph 4.1.5.<br>

<br>
5.5. Password and private keys.<br>
5.5.1. The user is personally responsible for the security and secrecy of the password for his/her username. The system does not store user passwords. The system saves the result (hash) of a special hash function from the password when registering a username or changing a password. It is impossible to recover the password back from the hash. You can see how hash functions like SHA work in the internet.<br>
5.5.2. The user can use password reset feature if he/she forgot password to own account. The user must create three questions with answers in self profile to be able to use the feature in the future. Answers to questions should be known only to the user himself. The user is personally responsible for remember and secrecy of these answers.<br>
5.5.3. The user can give incorrect answers only three times when uses password reset. If the user gave three incorrect answers the feature to reset the password for this username is blocked for 24 hours.<br>
5.5.3. If the user gave correct answers to the all questions the system provides temporary random password. The user must log into the own account using this temporary password and immediately change this password to a new password.<br>
5.5.3. A user that has lost access to his username has no right to register a new username according paragraph 4.1.5 of this Smart Contract T0.<br>
<br>
5.6. Each user takes personal responsibility for their actions in the NiXeL application and other parts of iol.<br>
<br>
<b>Risks</b><br>
<br>
All users accept the same risks, and they are associated with force majeure, i.e. circumstances when users cannot do something that they should do and when users do something but must not do. These typically include: wars, hostilities, floods, fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters, strikes, changes in applicable laws, or any other circumstances that the affected user cannot realistically control and which the user could not reasonably foresee.<br>
<br>
Since NiXeL and the entire iol ecosystem/platform is built on numerous paid, free software products, third party open source programs, FSP services, cloud services, version control systems, database management systems, blockchain networks and, user-authors are distributed people who work on their parts of the system remotely, then the risks, along with force majeure, include: software bugs (operating systems, services, frameworks, libraries, etc.), failures of devices, equipment, FSPs, communications and the Internet, illness and / or departure of some authors , limitations of banking systems and services (such as SWIFT, Visa, MasterCard, UnionPay, etc.), incompatibility of versions of previously used system components, restrictions and / or unavailability of resources for installing and updating applications (Google Play, Apple AppStore, etc. .), restrictions on access to resources from states and regions and cyber attacks.
<br>
User-authors are most interested in the long-term existing of NiXeL and the entire iol system and the improvement of their functionalities. They maintain their parts of the systems at their own expense and, to the best of their ability, seek to prevent the risks described above or correct the situation that has arisen. To attempt to correct the consequences of cyber attacks may be used paragraph 5.4 of this Smart Contract T0.<br>
<br>
<b>Tips and Recommendations</b><br>
<br>

<br>
Renew documents immediately when they expire.<br>
