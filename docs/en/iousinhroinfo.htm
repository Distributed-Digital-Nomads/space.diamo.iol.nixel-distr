<b>IOU</b> — “I Owe You” of the Internet of Labor iol-ecosystem/platform»: The idea of IOU comes from that any job has been done in some place must cost the same as the same job is done in another place. For instance, you have done some job in a country for 1 IOU. It means that you can order the same job in another country for 1 IOU. But a problem arise here: a job costs different amount in different countries. iol has a solution: 1 IOU must equal 1 hour minimal wage of the country where the job has been done.<br>
The architecture of iol allows pay for job by IOU. Also, it can temporary partly solve local and global economic problems.<br>
In essence, IOU is not any currency or asset. IOU can be defined as <b>”Unnamed Bearer IOU”</b>. In this way, mutual repayment of debts is ensured.<br>
IOU cannot be bought or sold for any currency. This is how the “work-price” price balance is achieved in countries with different economic levels and harmonization with local regulations.<br>
<br>
<b>SINHRO</b> internal mechanism of iol for synchronizing the balance in iol, official currencies of countries, regulated assets, shares of commissions of iol providers, copyright and intellectual properties, digital assets, global intellectual, law enforcement and financial structures, old and new economies.<br>
SINHRO is backed only by real labour.<br>
Order of SINHRO emission:<br>
- upon completion of the job received in any iol provider, in return for the deducted commissions iol calculates the amount of SINHRO at the current exchange rate to the currency of job cost. This amount of SINHRO is credited to the balance of the user that paid the commission;<br>
- iol issues SINHRO and credits it to the author's balance after the user's job added to the system.<br>
The SINHRO exchange rate relative to other currencies and assets is determined by the transactions made between users. Users that wish to exchange SINHRO to another currency can do that touching SINHRO in NiXeL balance:<br>
- check SINHRO buy/sell offers from other users that wait for matching offers. If you select an offer from this list and specify the quantity, the deal will be executed by <b>SinhroBot</b> immediately;<br>
-  set buy/sell at the desired price and amount. If there are suitable offers in the system, then SinhroBot will execute the deal immediately, otherwise it will be visible in the list “Show other offers” to other users. Own offers that wait for deal user can see in "My offers" list. The amount of the proposed asset will be moved to the Pending field in balance. Users can cancel own offers in “My orders”.<br>
Current SINHRO rate against currencies is determined by the last transaction.<br>
If there is no current exchange rate for a particular currency, then the exchange rate is calculated relative to the current SINHRO exchange rate, recalculated according to the FSP exchange rate.
To limit the amount of SINHRO available in iol system use the following SINHRO extinguishment mechanism:<br>
- in cases when job is for SINHRO (“payment in SINHRO”) the iol provider fee is charged in the same amount as when paying in other currencies. But in those cases it does not make sense in generation new SINHRO. Therefore, fee in SINHRO remains on the account of the iol provider forever as a parameter of the rating of this iol provider. iol providers are not persons so, the amount of SINHRO cannot be used in the iol anymore. This is ensured by SINHRO's inflation countermeasures preventing its depreciation.<br>
<b>SinhroBot</b> can prevent exchange rate manipulation. For example, an attacker wanted to influence the current price of SINHRO by trying to sell a small amount of SINHRO for parice less than others offer. SinhroBot will execute it so: SinhroBot will buy from him for his price and sell for the maximum price in the Buy list. Thus, it will only fix the more expensive cost of SINHRO and it most likely leads to stable growth of SINHRO rate.<br>
SINHRO lets any user the feature to participate in fee share out of all iol providers.<br>
<u>SINHRO is not any kind of currency or asset in countries where taxes cannot be paid in SINHRO and cannot be regulated by of such countries.</u><br>
<b>ATTENTION! Beware of scammers!</b> SINHRO cannot be sold or traded anywhere except on the official NiXeL app.<br>
